This son of a gun caused me ton on problems since the regretful day i dared to try it. 

Dont understand why they bother to release this pile of bug into production. 

In a perfect utopia, you would be jailed for releasing such buggy OS.

Reasons for upgrade:
- Dark UI, im lovin' it.
- More extensible night light stuff
- Package manager was giving warnings about LTS was about to come to an end.
- Had to do it to em tho.

#### Problems i encountered:
- Upgrade to 20.04 from 18.04 was crazy difficult, took me hours of terminal work to prepare and start it.
- Upgrade broke the system to kingdom come, whole ubuntu-desktop went to trash.
- Plot twist: it also broke package-management-system, therefore i just cannot even install simplest packages. 
- Had to save my whole env using good ol "cp" command.
- Fresh install was inevitable.

- The whole "Settings" went missing several times, what ? Had to install ubuntu-desktop again. This one is hella funny.
- ~~"afp://" protocol doesn't even work anymore, whole NAS bookmarks went down the drain. Had to stick with stinky "smb://"~~ 
//My god it just started to work outta nowhere, hope it stays that way.
- Right-click (context-menu) on usb-drive using Nautilus File manager, clicking format option doesn't do anything. 
- Cannot rename usb drive for some reason.
- GNOME menu and UI locks down for whatever reason. Solution: Alt+F2 and type "r" enter. Still bugs me off.
